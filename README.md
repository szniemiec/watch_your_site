This program doesn't work.

What I managed to do:
- setup Django project
- setup PostgreSQL database
- create models and manipulate them
- create simple view with it's own endpoint
- import celery
- run single task
- add intervals dependent on the list of tasks got from database

What i couldn't do:
- add periodic tasks, with it's interval, depending on list of tasks got from database what resulted in not completing rest of program
